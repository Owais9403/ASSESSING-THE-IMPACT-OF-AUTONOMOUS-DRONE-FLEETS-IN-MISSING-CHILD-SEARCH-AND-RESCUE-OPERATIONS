![Architecture](path/to/architecture_image.png)

This project aims to develop an innovative solution for finding lost children using AI-powered drones. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and drone technology, we aim to significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of search and rescue operations.

## Proposed System

![Proposed System](path/to/proposed_system_image.png)

The proposed approach involves the use of AI-powered drones equipped with real-time object detection capabilities to locate missing children. Key components of the proposed system include:

- Utilization of AI-powered drones for rapid coverage of large areas and real-time data streaming to rescue teams.
- Implementation of a YOLOv8 model on a Raspberry Pi for real-time human detection.
- Ten-step process including model training, drone calibration, and safe operation procedures.
